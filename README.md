# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️

A simple, interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was created as part of The Odin Project Curriculum!

## Features

- Interactive buttons for player choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- Randomized computer choices each round
- Score tracking for both player and computer
- Dynamic messages showing round results
- Game ends when either player reaches 5 points
- Game result displayed with reset-ready scores

## How to Play

1. Click on one of the choices: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer will make a random move.
3. The result of the round is displayed, and scores are updated.
4. First to 5 points wins the game — then the scores reset automatically when you continue to play.
